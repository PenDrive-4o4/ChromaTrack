1. Real-Time Object Tracking with Color
Combine color detection with object tracking to follow objects of a specific color in real-time.
Use algorithms like MeanShift, CamShift, or deep learning-based trackers (e.g., SORT or DeepSORT) for robust tracking.

2. Multi-Color Detection and Segmentation
Detect and segment multiple colors simultaneously in a single frame.
Use clustering algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN to identify dominant colors in an image.

3. Adaptive Color Detection
Implement adaptive color detection that adjusts to lighting conditions (e.g., shadows, brightness changes).
Use techniques like histogram equalization or dynamic thresholding to improve robustness.

4. Machine Learning for Color Classification
Train a machine learning model (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, or CNN) to classify colors more accurately.
Use a pre-trained model like YOLO or Mask R-CNN for object detection and color classification.

5. Interactive GUI and Visualization  
Create an interactive GUI using libraries like Tkinter, PyQt, or OpenCV's built-in functions.
Visualize detected colors, masks, and bounding boxes in real-time.
